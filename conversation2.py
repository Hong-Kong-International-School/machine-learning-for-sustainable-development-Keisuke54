    '''Question: 1. How can you solve for the charge on a capacitor in a transient state by using integral equations?
Answer: You can solve for the charge on a capacitor in a transient state by using integral equations by following these steps:
Identify the transient state: The transient state is when the capacitor is initially charged and then discharged. The capacitor will discharge through the circuit, and the charge will be equal to the integral of the current over time.
Write the integral equation: The integral equation for the charge on a capacitor in a transient state can be written as:
Q = ∫I dt
Solve the integral equation: To solve the integral equation, you can use a technique called integration by parts. This will give you a series of equations that you can solve for the unknowns in the circuit.
Find the final charge: Once you have solved the integral equation, you will have the final charge on the capacitor. This will be the integral of the current over time.

Answer: To find the electromagnetic field for a uniform conducting sphere, you can use the following approach:
Consider the electric field that would be produced by a point charge located at the center of the sphere. This electric field would be uniform in strength and would radiate outward from the center of the sphere.
Now, consider the magnetic field that would be produced by this electric field. The magnetic field would be perpendicular to the electric field and would be directed outward from the center of the sphere.
Now, consider the full electromagnetic field, which is the combination of the electric and magnetic fields. This electromagnetic field would be uniform in strength and would radiate outward from the center of the sphere.
