# PhysiGPT

## Background
In recent days, many large language models (LLMs) are being open source while other models cost . Thsi ahs brought a huge inequality in educaiton due to accessibility. Hence, this project aims to achieve a model that supports peope's leanring through machien learning model, specificaly for AP Physics C. 
*** Quality Educaiton ***

## System details
The system included in this repository is the main language model about AP Physics C, speech to text (voice recognition), and text to speech to achieve real time Q&A expereince for physics concepts. 

### What it does
You speek to the model, they'll understand the speech, and will respond to your Physics question by speeaking out 

### How it works
The model recognizes speech via OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition model

### How to install it
Given the limitation in time to work, there is no app to downlod this model yet ( real time Q&A app), but you can install this model and will be available in Apple platform  

How to use it

## Model Details
The main language model is

## Data sources used for training
As shown in 'DataGeneration.py' file, 

Include a link to the original data. GitHub won't allow large uploads so it's best to upload this separately to cloud storage such as Google Drive.
