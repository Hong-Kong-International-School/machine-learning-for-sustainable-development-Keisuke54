# PhysiGPT

## Background
In recent days, many large language models (LLMs) are being open source while other models cost . Thsi ahs brought a huge inequality in educaiton due to accessibility. Hence, this project aims to achieve a model that supports peope's leanring through machien learning model, specificaly for AP Physics C. 
*** Quality Educaiton ***

## System details
The system included in this repository is the main language model about AP Physics C, speech to text (voice recognition), and text to speech to achieve real time Q&A expereince for physics concepts. 

### What it does
You speek to the model, they'll understand the speech, and will respond to your Physics question by speeaking out 

### How it works
The model recognizes speech via OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition model
Then the converted text is passed through LLM and get the response
The response is converted into speech via 

### How to install it
Given the limitation in time to work, there is no app to downlod this model yet (real time Q&A app), but you can install the whole python file and convert each component into app development 

### How to use it
For now, save the speech in files like mp3, upload it, and run 

## Model Details
The main language model is built with karas sequential model consisting of Embedding, two LSTM, and Dense layers 

The input data is a collection of text from the beginning to 
The ouput data is a collection of next text of each collection of input data 
Both of these are converted into sequence using tokenizer 

> e.g. "Apple" --> input = [A, Ap, App, Appl], output = [p, p, l, e]

## Data sources used for training
As shown in 'DataGeneration.py' file, the training data was generated by first amplifying the initial prompts 10 times by passing it to Cohere using API, and answering all the amplified questions by passing them to Cohere using API again.
